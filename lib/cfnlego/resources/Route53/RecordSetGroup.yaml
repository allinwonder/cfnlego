If AWS CloudFormation cannot find a hosted zone with a matching domain name, or if there is more than one hosted zone with the specified domain name, AWS CloudFormation will not create the stack.  If you have multiple hosted zones with the same domain name, you must explicitly specify the hosted zone using HostedZoneId.  Required: Conditional. You must specify either the HostedZoneName or HostedZoneId, but you cannot specify both."
