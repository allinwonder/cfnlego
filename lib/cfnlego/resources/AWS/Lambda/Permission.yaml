  Properties:

    FunctionName: "\"The name (physical ID) or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function that you want to associate with this statement.\""
    Principal: "\"The entity for which you are granting permission to invoke the Lambda function. This entity can be any valid AWS service principal, such as s3.amazonaws.com or sns.amazonaws.com, or, if you are granting cross-account permission, an AWS account ID.\""
    SourceAccount: "\"The AWS account ID (without hyphens) of the source owner. For example, if you specify an S3 bucket in the SourceArn property, this value is the bucket owner's account ID. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific account.\""
